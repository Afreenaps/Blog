    <p style="width: 700px; height: 150px;"><em>Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a self-help book that encourages people to stop trying to be positive all the time and instead face the truth — life is hard, and we only have so many "f*cks to give." So we should choose wisely what really matters.

Mark Manson argues that happiness comes from solving meaningful problems, not avoiding them. Instead of chasing success and approval from others, we should focus on what’s truly important to us. He promotes values like honesty, responsibility, and acceptance of failure.

The book uses blunt language, real-life examples, and humor to deliver serious advice on living a better, more grounded life.
