    <p style="width: 600px; height: 150px;"><i>A Court of Thorns and Roses is a fantasy novel that follows Feyre Archeron, a mortal huntress who kills a wolf in the woods — only to discover it was actually a faerie in disguise. As punishment, she is taken to the magical land of Prythian by Tamlin, a powerful High Fae lord.

At first, Feyre is a prisoner, but as she learns more about Tamlin's world, she finds herself falling in love with him. However, an ancient curse threatens the entire faerie realm, and Feyre must fight for her love and survival — facing deadly trials, a dark queen, and the truth about her own strength.

The book blends romance, magic, adventure, and fairy-tale elements, inspired loosely by Beauty and the Beast, with a darker and more mature twist.</i>
